It is addressed to the application-oriented end-user who wants to take advantage of the already existing functions and interface of the latest release of OpenIndy.

The developer documentation explains the concept and structure behind OpenIndy, how the functions are developed and implemented and how to work in the QT framework environment
so that you can easily write your own plugins and join the open source development process.
