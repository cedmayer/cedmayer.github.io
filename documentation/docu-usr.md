##Getting started

This guide introduces you to the software OpenIndy and provides information about system connections and
interfaces.

##Introducing the graphical user interface (GUI)

The graphical user interface (GUI) gives the user instant access to all measurement functions and plugins, making it easy to perform and analyse a measuring procedure.
The most frequently used functions are displayed as icons on a toolbar, allowing quick and easy access to the measurement information.
The forms-based graphical interaction helps you define your measurement quickly and easily. 
Each form tab is labeled with its content, preventing you from getting lost in the defining process.

### Tableview
{:.no_toc}
the tableview is a tabular representation of the features and their attributes. Each row represents one feature (e.g. one point) and the columns represent the metadata, attributes and values, number of observations for this geometry, measurement configuration and the functions of this feature.

###Graphic view

The 3D graphic view, using OpenGL, gives the opportunity for a graphical representation of the features and their dependencies. The graphic view also contains a small tree view that contains all features and their attributes.
