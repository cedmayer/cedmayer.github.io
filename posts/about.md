OpenIndy is a metrology software solution that can be extended by [plugins](https://github.com/OpenIndy/OiPluginTemplate). The project started in 2013 as a student project in the Department of Geoinformatics and Surveying ([HS Mainz](https://www.hs-mainz.de/technology/geoinformatics-and-surveying/index.html){:target="blank"}). Our primary goal is to attract students and to jointly develop and learn. For more information take a look at the [OpenIndy Documentation](/documentation).
